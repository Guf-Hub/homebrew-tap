  caveats <<~EOS
    Blankly is not notarized by Apple, so on first launch macOS says
    "Blankly.app" Not Opened. Click Done (not Move to Trash), then:
      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway → Open Anyway
    Or in Terminal:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Blankly.app
  EOS
end
